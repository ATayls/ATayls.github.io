# About Me

Welcome to my professional page! I am a seasoned data professional with over 6 years of experience addressing complex data science and engineering challenges across academia, industry, and the NHS. My career is dedicated to developing data, analytical, and machine learning pipelines that solve real-world health data problems. I am currently interested in the Data Engineer role at UKHSA, where I believe I can make a significant contribution.

## Experience

### Digital Research Service, Nottingham University

At the Digital Research Service (DRS) of Nottingham University, I hold a pivotal role in advancing healthcare data analytics and digital research. My contributions focus on leveraging cutting-edge data science techniques to support and enhance academic research within the healthcare domain.

#### Key Responsibilities:

- **Project Leadership and Management:**
  - I direct and oversee a range of data-oriented projects from initiation to delivery, ensuring they meet strict timelines and high standards of quality.
  - My role as principal investigator on collaborations, such as with the Nottingham City Council, involves orchestrating the technical efforts of the DRS team and facilitating interdisciplinary cooperation across various university faculties and administrative departments.

- **Technical Leadership in Healthcare Data Projects:**
  - As a technical lead, I am responsible for the conceptualization and implementation of robust data pipelines tailored to the specific needs of healthcare research.
  - I develop and standardize ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes that efficiently handle large volumes of unstructured clinical data, transforming them into actionable insights.

- **Advanced Data Analytics and Modelling:**
  - I employ advanced statistical and machine learning methods, including time-series forecasting, ensemble methods, and model stacking to enhance the accuracy and reliability of patient outcome predictions.
  - My work also involves developing interpretability frameworks, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values, to ensure the transparency and usability of our predictive models for healthcare professionals.

- **Stakeholder Engagement and Collaboration:**
  - I actively engage with key stakeholders within and outside the university, including senior academics and clinicians, to ensure the alignment of our data projects with broader research objectives and clinical needs.
  - This role demands excellent communication skills to convey complex data-driven insights to non-technical stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making processes.

- **Mentorship and Team Development:**
  - I lead the onboarding and continuous professional development of junior data scientists, fostering a culture of technical excellence and innovation within the team.
  - My mentorship extends to hosting weekly planning and review sessions to ensure the team remains on the cutting edge of data science applications and methodologies.

#### Impact:

The impact of my work at the DRS is reflected in significant improvements in data handling and analytical processes, contributing to more efficient and impactful research outcomes. Our collaborations and the methodologies I have developed are instrumental in advancing the university's reputation as a leader in digital healthcare research.

#### Recent Achievements:

- My leadership in cross-departmental projects has been crucial in several high-profile publications and presentations, including a recent article in The Lancet detailing our findings in healthcare data analytics.
- I have been instrumental in driving the adoption of new technologies and methodologies within the DRS, significantly enhancing our analytical capabilities and the scope of our research impact.

This role not only utilizes my extensive data science expertise but also underscores my commitment to applying data-driven solutions to real-world problems, particularly in improving healthcare outcomes and research efficacy at Nottingham University.

### Airbus
At Airbus, I tackled complex unstructured satellite data, developing data-oriented products from prototype to production. Notable projects include:

- Developing a pipeline for image segmentation to map 2.8 million field boundaries across the UK.

## Skills

- **Programming:** Proficient in Python and its ecosystems, with over 5 years of experience in code development and maintenance.
- **Version Control:** Expert in using Git for development and collaboration.
- **Project Management:** Agile methodology and Azure DevOps for sprint-based project management.
- **Data Governance:** Standardizing technical approaches and instilling robust data governance procedures within teams.

## Education and Outreach

- I regularly deliver training courses and lectures on Python for analytics, data manipulation, and pipelining to university staff and students.
- I thrive on sharing knowledge and best practices, continuously updating my skills with new technologies.

## Communication

- Effective communicator of complex ideas to diverse audiences, including academics, clinical staff, and external stakeholders.
- Use of data flow diagrams and ML interpretability methods to make analytical results understandable and actionable for clinicians.
